 A Project Report On Auto Shop Submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the award of degree of  Bachelor of Business Administration (Computer Application)  Submitted By:  Aman Kumar
1: INTRODUCTION


  		 INTRODUCTION TO SYSTEM
This proposed system is developed to manage the automobiles of an automobile dealer company. The main modules of this project are login, automobile management, customer management, sales, complaints and reports. The main objective of this project is to manage steps in purchasing and selling automobiles. Through this project we have tried to minimize manual work with the use of automated system. This system can help to keep records of customer registration details, vehicle booking details, vehicle exchange details, vehicle details etc. 
Handling a huge amount of data, recovering the loss of information, gathering details of every customer etc becomes tedious for the employees. Hence to overcome this issue, this software is developed where, all the information is preloaded and can be fetched in a click. This project includes the customers who visit the showroom, dealers who deal with the selling of cars, employee who handles the software and database etc


   






2.Existing System:-
In existing system everything is done manually. Every guest of certain event has to follow a long procedure to know about the event and the allocation of the tables and the seats in the event . 
Data about the guest and event is handled manually which come up with the risk of losing data which can lead to waste of time to recollect all the information.
In the existing system allocation of the seats and data management is done manually but in proposed system we have computerized the whole process using this application.
In case of following process manually we need a lot of time and manpower. Here, almost all work is computerized. Maintaining backup is very easy. It saves time as well as increases the efficiency.

Disadvantage of existing manual system

•	Existing system is manual which requires a lot of paper work and it requires a lot of time for managing and processing.

•	It is difficult for any guest to completely know about the arrangement made for the event as many of the instruction are to read by him/her.

•	We have to create a list of allocation of the guest and provide the information about the allocation individually which is time consuming process.

•	The limitation of existing system is that it is not all customized. It cannot be used for personal and quick reference.

 
3.Proposed System

The proposed system can overcome all the limitation of the existing system. The system provides proper security and reduces the manual work.
The aim of proposed system is to develop a system of improved facilities multiple number of records can be stored in this system and searched and Updated in few seconds.
There is no loss of any data and records as all data is stored in oracle database.
We can keep backup on the pen-drive or cd, then there is no chance of wrong entry.

•	Security of data
•	Minimum manual data entry 
•	Minimum time needed for various processing 
•	Better services 
•	User friendliness and interactive
•	Reduces paper work , time and manpower 
•	Greater efficiency
 
 4. Advantages of Proposed system


•	Security of data
•	Minimum manual data entry 
•	Minimum time needed for various processing 
•	Better services 
•	User friendliness and interactive
•	Reduces paper work , time and manpower 
•	Greater efficiency
 
5.Scope  

In computer system the person has to fill the various form and number of copies of the form can be easily generated at a time.
In this application, number of VIP should be less than or equal to 40, number of staff members or employee of the organization should be less than or equal to 60 and other than staff member or their relatives can be added up to 80 only.
Generated type of information will only be based on type of information provided to the system.
For proper execution of the application the required .dll file sand oracle Database should be installed. 
 
6.FEASIBILITY SYUDY

Feasibility study is useful to evaluate the cost and benefit of the system requested. This is nothing but a test, which is conducted on the proposed system, how the requirements are achieved. It is also used to understand the scope. The feasibility study tries to anticipate future scenarios of    software development.
There are three major aspects in the feasibility study
1.	Technical feasibility.
2.	Economical Feasibility
3.  Operational feasibility

Technical Feasibility
The technical feasibility always focuses on the existing computer hardware and software personnel. This includes the need for more hardware or software personnel and the possibility of procuring or installing such facility.
The proposed system of event management does not require additional hardware and software. The proposed system has the minimum requirement for hardware and software which are easily available. Hence the proposed system is technically feasible.

Economical Feasibility
Economical feasibility considers the cost benefits analysis of the proposed system. The benefits are always expected to be overweighting the cost. Economical feasibility is helpful to find the system development cost hence and checks whether it is justifiable for that it concentrate on.
1.	Investigation cost.
2.	Software and hardware cost.
3.	Salaries and maintenance cost.
4.	Supply cost


Operational Feasibility

It considers the acceptability of the system. It checks whether system will be used if it developed and implemented. It checks whether the users of the system will be able to handle as if the proposed system does not create any problems.
The proposed system will be easy to handle as the overview is according to the requirement of the user. It reduces extra workload of the user providing to be beneficial. Hence the proposed system is operationally feasible.
The proposed system requires minimum hardware and maintenance cost.Hence it is economical feasibility.

 
7.HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:-
Software requirements for this system are as listed follows:- 
•	Front-End        :           Visual Studio 2015
•	Backend           :           Microsoft access db
•	Operating System    :    Windows 10
